bellBellBellBell is an open source bell scheduler that works over SIP and has user configuratble zones with bell schedules all logged and can act as an interactive map and pa system. 

Currently just a test python script that just works.

To do:
- Web interface (Dashboard, maps, zones, schedules, system options)
- Local SQLite Database
- Each zone has 1 sip connection
- User system with logging
- Bell logging with results if ran or not
